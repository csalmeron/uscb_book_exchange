### About the Project
The USCB Textbook Exchange website is a localized web web service for the students at the University of South Carolina Beaufort. The web service connects students who want to save on textbooks to those who want an alternative to selling to retailers. Students have the option to buy, sell, or donate their textbooks. Students can receive payment and textbooks faster than utilizing a retailer while paying nothing at all.

### Implementation
> This web service will be coded using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). The web service will consist of front-end development in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The backend will consist of PHP using the CakePHP framework that will be responsible for handling and manipulating data that is received from the frontend and sending/receiving it to/from the MySQL database.
